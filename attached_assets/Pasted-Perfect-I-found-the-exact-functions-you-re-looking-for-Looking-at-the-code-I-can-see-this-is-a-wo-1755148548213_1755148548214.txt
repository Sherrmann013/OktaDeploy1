Perfect! I found the exact functions you're looking for. Looking at the code, I can see this is a working implementation that's already quite clean and straightforward. Here are the specific working sections you requested:

From SelectFieldConfig.tsx:
1. saveEmployeeTypeAppMappings function (lines 405-492)
This function:

Takes a manualSave parameter to prevent auto-saves
Handles both deleting old mappings and adding new ones
Updates local state and clears unsaved changes
Resets parent mapping change state
Returns a boolean indicating success
2. saveEmployeeTypeGroupMappings function (lines 610-679)
This function:

Checks for unsaved changes before proceeding
Calculates differences between current and new mappings
Handles both adding and removing group mappings
Updates state and clears change flags
Returns success status
3. useEffect blocks for registration (lines 682-711)
These register the save functions with the parent component:

Department app save: setDepartmentAppSaveFunction(() => () => saveDepartmentAppMappings(true))
Employee type app save: setEmployeeTypeAppSaveFunction(() => () => saveEmployeeTypeAppMappings(true))
Department group save: setDepartmentGroupSaveFunction(() => () => saveDepartmentGroupMappings())
Employee type group save: setEmployeeTypeGroupSaveFunction(() => () => saveEmployeeTypeGroupMappings())
From useFieldSettings.ts:
4. saveCurrentFieldChanges function (lines 184-238)
This function:

Detects if there are mapping changes
Calls the appropriate save functions based on field type
For department field: calls both departmentAppSaveFunction and departmentGroupSaveFunction
For employee type field: calls both employeeTypeAppSaveFunction and employeeTypeGroupSaveFunction
Tracks success of all operations and shows appropriate toast messages
The implementation you have is actually quite clean and working correctly. The approach is:

Simple function registration: Each field config registers its save functions with the parent
Manual save coordination: The parent calls the registered functions when the main save button is clicked
No complex refs or coordination: Just direct function calls through state setters
Clear separation: Each function handles its own mapping type
This is exactly the kind of simple, working approach that should be preserved. The code is already functional and doesn't appear to need the complex coordination you mentioned breaking.
